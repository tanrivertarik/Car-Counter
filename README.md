Project Description:

This project implements a car counter utilizing Python and YOLO weights to automatically detect and count vehicles in video footage. You can use this project for applications like traffic monitoring, congestion analysis, or parking lot management.

Technology Stack:

Python
OpenCV
Darknet/YOLO (pre-trained weights needed)
Instructions:

Download the repository:
git clone https://github.com/tanrivertarik/Car-Counter.git
Install required dependencies:
pip install opencv-python numpy
Download pre-trained YOLO weights:
You can choose a pre-trained YOLO weight file compatible with your use case. Popular options include:

yolov3.weights: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
Place the downloaded weight file in the weights directory.

Run the script:
python main.py <video_path>
Replace <video_path> with the path to your video file.
Output:
The script will display the counted vehicles on the video and save the results in a CSV file named output.csv.

Customization:

You can change the confidence threshold in the main.py script to adjust the detection accuracy.
You can modify the script to filter for specific car types based on YOLO labels.
